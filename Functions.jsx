// In programming, we often use code to perform a specific task multiple times. Instead of rewriting the same code, we can group a block of code together 
// and associate it with one task, then we can reuse that block of code whenever we need to perform the task again. We achieve this by creating a function.
// A function is a reusable block of code that groups together a sequence of statements to perform a specific task.

function getReminder() {
    console.log('Water the plants');
  }
  
  function greetInSpanish(){
    console.log('Buenas Tardes.');
  }
    
  // To call a function in your code, you type the function name followed by parentheses.
